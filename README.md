# Explanation
It basically just logs the victim by opening the GIF but instead injects a XSS script that logs them with a stub or not.



This is for educational purposes only! Please use this at your own risk as token logging although is not illegal it can be a hurtful thing to do to someone

# Tutorial
So basically download the py file and it then finds the jpg file and replaces the file with an exe of your stub link, therefore opening the exe file as the victim (dummie) opens the jpg thinking it's just a harmless jpg and it opens an exe. I'd recommend just getting replit or glithc or something to run this one, this then you send the victim the file and they will open and it will log them!

# Warning
So be warned. There are like fake image or gif loggers out there saying if u click on the image/gif once it will basically just log your cookies and ip, this is actually impossible unless the image (which is actually being upload to discord attachments which contains no malicous code as it wont bypass api) has a secret code in it. These dumb people sell it for like 800 robux or roughly 10 bucks and they will send them a stub or just a fake image to use. So make sure to be very careful as many image loggers in this community are fake and there are real ones.
